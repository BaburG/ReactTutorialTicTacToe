Welcome to the **React Tutorial Tic-Tac-Toe** project! This repository contains the code for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using React. This project is perfect for those who want to learn and practice the fundamentals of React while creating a fun and interactive game. 🎉

## Features ✨

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Interactive gameplay with two players
- Visual indication of the winning line
- Code structured for learning and clarity

## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation 🔧

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaburG/ReactTutorialTicTacToe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ReactTutorialTicTacToe
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
